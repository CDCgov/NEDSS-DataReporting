## Getting Started

### Onboarding Steps

The onboarding process involves a combination of manual and automated steps. Follow the sequence below to prepare the environment:

#### 1. Create Admin and Service Users (Manual Only)
Run the scripts located in the following directories manually. This step creates an admin user and individual service users:

- `001-master/01_onboarding_scripts_user_creation/`

These scripts set up core roles and foundational database functions.

#### 2. Deploy Database Objects (Liquibase or Manual)

For each database (`001-master`,`002-srte`, `003-odse`, `004-rdb`, `005-rdb_modern`), deploy the following object types:

- `tables/`
- `views/`
- `functions/`
- `routines/`
- `jobs/`
- `remove/`

These objects can be deployed via:

- **Liquibase**: For automated rollout. Changelog are provided to execute scripts in required order.
- **Manual Execution**: For environments without Liquibase. Scripts are provided to create and update necessary objects. 

Future enhancements will be delivered under this section. 

#### 3. Load Data and Start CDC (Manual or Batch Script)

After all objects have been successfully deployed, run the following scripts to complete database setup.

- `001-master/02_onboarding_script_data_load/`

This loads key-uid mapping onto key tables for RTR and activates **Change Data Capture** for required tables in NBS_ODSE and NBS_SRTE.

> This can be automated via a **batch script** with the `--load-data` flag for the master database schema.  
> Note: Liquibase does **not** support this step directly.

### Script Execution

Choose your preferred deployment method below:

---

### Option 1:  Liquibase Deployment 

Automated deployment using Liquibase ensures consistent and traceable changes to your database schema.

ðŸ“„ [Liquibase Deployment Documentation](liquibase-service/src/main/resources/db/readme.md)

---

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

Manual deployment allows for more granular control and is suitable for environments without Liquibase.
